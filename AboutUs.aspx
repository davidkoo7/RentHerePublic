								<p>Being the first in Singapore market, our mission is to aim towards the creation of a platform for the rental of items and services that can be rented. This is especially so since many people tend to buy items for a onetime event, then sell it off or just put it aside in case of such event happening again. 
‘RentHere’ would be an online a rental platform based and operated in Singapore which allows users to rent items/services that are difficult to get and/or useful for certain occasions. Based on a consumer-to-consumer business model, ‘RentHere’ brings together people who want to rent and people who rent out their items/services. Items and services our website might encourage people to rent are Evening gowns, wedding dresses and extendable BBQ pit, electric generator, while services include flower arrangement, pedicure and limousine renting. In our website, process of renting items is simplified by having multiple categories to choose from and a search bar with filtering system. </p>
